# LspSolver

LspSolver is a lot sizing problems **solver tool**. LspSolver started as a research project in the Computer Science Research and Training Institute (IFRI-UAC), intends to apply **intelligence artificial methods** (like genetic algorithms or artificial neural networks) in solving the lot sizing problems. It is developed with speed and modularity in mind.

Usage
------------

The whole set of input data is stored in the folder `data/input`. Two formats of input files exist, hence the two ways of reading these formats are implemented. Implemented in the first format, `data/input/clsp01.data` is the easiest instance of the set : 2 items, 5 periods. 
To make the program run on this instance, use the command : 

    python3.6 src/hcm_main.py -v data/input/clspInst01.data
